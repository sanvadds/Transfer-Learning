# Transfer-Learning 
Taking a pre-trained model of different problem and try to retrain it on different problem. In this project we have taken a **MOBILENET_V2** pre-trained model of google from tensorflow hub and use that model to classify flower data set. Previously it use to take so many epochs(iterations) to train a model but with this technique model will train within 2 to 5 epochs, this technique is called as **TRANSFER LEARNING.**
